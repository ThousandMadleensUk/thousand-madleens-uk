With a lineup featuring Ivo Graham, Amir El-Masry, Fatiha El-Ghorri and Thomas Green, the squad of amputee athletes and their community have programmed a very special event at beloved Islington venue, Union Chapel.\n\nThe Gaza Sunbirds have gained global recognition over the last two years for their courageous aid missions in the strip. The team formed in 2020 with a dream of representing Palestine on the sporting world stage. Forced to give up their training regime in 2023 due to the Israeli bombardment, they turned their attention to supporting their local community. Since then, they have been risking their lives on one leg to distribute $520,000+ USD worth of food and supplies in Southern and central Gaza. The show will fundraise for their work in the strip as well as international goals such as entering Palestine's first para-cyclists to the LA 2028 Paralympics. A portion of the proceeds will also go to Thousand Madleens to Gaza, a citizen led initiative aiming to break the siege on Gaza.\n\n*This event is for 16+, under 18s must be accompanied by an adult",
