It continues a legacy of resistance that began with the Free Gaza Movement in 2008 and FFC's missions since 2010. We sail because world powers enable Israel's illegal siege.

Yet our governments continue to arm, fund, and profit from this horror. We cannot wait for permission. We cannot wait for leaders who have chosen complicity over humanity. The urgency demands not one ship, but waves of ships."
